# Dayscorer
Dayscorer is a web-application where you can fill in data to see how your day has been, as well as your week.

## installation
Every file of the app is included, all you need to do is host, i used a virtualhost through XAMPP, how you do it is up to you.
Remember to run the sql code in database_import.sql into your database software, this sets up the bare necessities to get the app running. I can't guarentee it works with every database software as i've only used phpmyadmin. 

## Usage
First, visit the page. You will be urged create an account, after which you will end up on the home page, a popup will appear for new users. I suggest you click yes, as it explains the site usage as well.

Dayscorer is mostly compatible with mobile devices, though sometimes you will have to rotate your device to properly show the page, for example: the week overview on the home page. if you rotate you phone horizontal it should work properly. tablets probably have much less issue.
